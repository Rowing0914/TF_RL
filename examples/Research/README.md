## Research Idea
1. Sharing state representation between an expert and a learner
2. Looking for a Breakthrough
3. Comparing Reward or State value or Q-value between an expert and a learner instead of directly getting action from an expert
4. Learning from a Bad expert and try avoiding that decision making
5. Sparring with an expert! An expert asks some questions about the given env to a learner and he will learn from it
6. Ranking demo trajectories according to Eligibility Traces
7. Neural SLAM to solve POMDP
8. Adaptive Discount Factor(experts tell this to the learner)
9. Ask-for-help approach with/without MCTS
